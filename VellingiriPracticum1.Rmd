<h4> Contact Tracing </h4>

<h6> Abirami Vellingiri Thirunavukkarasu </h6>

**USE CASE** :

Contact Tracing is a vast problem with several use cases, the following are the use cases considered while designing this database:
<ol>
<li>Track the locations visited by all the users of the app, and store information regarding the infection status of the user (infected, not infected, suspected of infection). Using this information all the contacts of an infected user can be identified.</li>
<li>Store test results, take regular assessments of the user’s vitals and symptoms via surveys and use this information to update the user’s infection status. This use case requires additional programming to implement and compute the values of the derived attributes. It will be done at a later stage via triggers, stored procedures, transactions and or application level code.</li>
</ol>

***

**ASSUMPTIONS** :

The following are the various assumptions made for each table in the database:
<ol>
<li><b>USER</b> : A User is anyone who accesses the contact tracing application. A User is a generalized class and has the subclasses NaiveUser and HealthCareAdmin. Generalization cannot be fully implemented through multiplicities alone. The disjoint nature of the subclasses will be enforced later on using transactions or triggers. The current multiplicities are, a User can be 0 or 1 HealthCareAdmin and a User can be 0 or 1 HealthCareAdmin.</li>
<li><b>HEALTH CARE ADMIN</b> : A HealthCareAdmin is a user who’s account had additional privileges than that of a NaiveUser. This will be enforced through application logic later on. Each Health Care Admin can be 1 User.</li>
<li><b>NAÏVE USER</b> : A NaïveUser is a member of the general public who uses the contact tracing system. Each NaïveUser can be 1 User. Each NaiveUser can make 0 to many Visits. Each NaiveUser takes 1 to many Survey. As soon as a NaiveUser registers and logs into the application they will be prompted to take a survey. So every NaiveUser will have taken at least one survey. Each NaiveUser takes 0 to many Tests. The infectionStatus of a NaiveUser indicates whether they are currently sick or not. This derived attribute will be updated using triggers later on.</li>
<li><b>TEST</b> : A Test is either an Antibody, or RT-PCR test. When the result has the Boolean value FALSE, it indicates that the NaiveUser is not sick. When the result has the Boolean value TRUE, it indicates the NaiveUser is sick. Each Test belongs to only one NaiveUser.</li>
<li><b>SURVEY</b> : Each Survey is taken by only one NaiveUser. The maskWorn variable is set to TRUE if the NaiveUser wore a mask that day and FALSE if they didn’t. Each Survey can record 0 to many Symptoms that a NaiveUser may have experienced that day.</li>
<li><b>SYMPTOMS</b> : Each symptom may be recorded in 0 or many Surveys that are taken by NaiveUsers. The values in the Symptoms table can be updated each time a new Symptom of COVID-19 is identified by the CDC or WHO.</li>
<li><b>VISIT</b> : The Visit table links the NaiveUser to all the Locations they may have visited. Each Visit belongs to only one NaiveUser and each Visit is made at only one Location.</li>
<li><b>LOCATION</b> : Each row of the Location table stores every gpsCoordinate that was visisted by at least one NaiveUser. A Location can be in 1 or many Visit. Each Location can have only one Zipcode.</li>
<li><b>ZIPCODE</b> : The Zipcode table stores the street, city and state corresponding to every Zipcode that a NaiveUser may have Visited. Each Zipcode has 1 or many Locations in it.</li></ol>

**RELATIONAL SCHEMA**

User(<u>userID</u>, password, firstName, lastName, phone)

HealthCareAdmin(<u><i>adminID</i></u>, region, qualification)

NaiveUser(<u><i>naiveUserID</i></u>, gender, DOB, lastSync, infectionStatus)

Zipcode(<u>zipcodeVal</u>, city, state, street)

Location(<u>locationID</u>, gpsCoordinate, <i>zipcode</i>)

Visit(<u>visitID</u>, <u><i>naiveUserID</i></u>, <u><i>locationID</i></u>, visitTime )

Survey(<u>surveyID</u>, temperature, maskWorn, dateOfSurvey, <i>naiveUserID</i>)

Symptoms(<u>symptomID</u>, symptomName)

SurveySymptoms(<u><i>symptomID</i></u>, <u><i>surveyID</i></u>)

Test(<u>testID</u>, testType, testDate, result, <i>naiveUserID</i>)

***

**NORMALIZATION**

<b>USER</b>

User(<u>userID</u>, password, firstName, lastName, phone)

The Functional Dependencies are,

userID => password

userID => firstName

userID => lastName

userID => phone

phone  => password

phone => firstName

phone => lastName

phone => userID 

Thus userID and Phone are the candidate keys. This relation is in BCNF as the candidate keys are the only determinants of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes. 


<b>HEALTH CARE ADMIN </b>

HealthCareAdmin(<u><i>adminID</i></u>, region, qualification)

The Functional Dependencies are,

adminID => qualification 

Thus adminID is the only candidate key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.


<b> NAÏVE USER </b>

NaiveUser(<u><i>naiveUserID</i></u>, gender, DOB, lastSync, infectionStatus)

The Functional Dependencies are,

naiveUserID => gender

naiveUserID => DOB

naiveUserID => lastSync

naiveUserID => infectionStatus

Thus naiveUserID is the only candidate key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> ZIPCODE </b>

Zipcode(<u>zipcodeVal</u>, city, state, street)

The Functional Dependencies are,

zipcodeVal => city

zipcodeVal => state

zipCodeVal => street

Since there may be more than one city in the same state with the same name, city does not determine state. There may also be more than one street with the same name in the same city. Thus zipcodeVal is the only candidate key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> LOCATION </b>

Location(<u>locationID</u>, gpsCoordinate, <i>zipcode</i>)

The Functional Dependencies are,

locationID => zipcode

locationID => gpsCoordinate

gpsCoordinate => zipcode

gpsCoordinate => locationID

Thus locationID and  gpsCoordinate are the candidate keys. This relation is in BCNF as the candidate keys are the only determinants of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> VISIT </b>

Visit(<u>visitID</u>, <u><i>naiveUserID</i></u>, <u><i>locationID</i></u>, visitTime )

visitID => naiveUserID

visitID => locationID

visitID => visitTime

visitID is the only candidate key and so it is the primary key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> SURVEY </b>

Survey(<u>surveyID</u>, temperature, maskWorn, dateOfSurvey, <i>naiveUserID</i>)

surveyID => temperature

surveyID => maskWorn

surveyID => dateOfSurvey

surveyID => naiveUserID

surveyID is the only candidate key and so it is the primary key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> SYMPTOMS </b>

Symptoms(<u>symptomID</u>, symptomName)

symptomID => symptomName

symptomName => symptomID

Thus symptomID and  symptomName are the candidate keys. This relation is in BCNF as the candidate keys are the only determinants of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.

<b> SURVEY SYMPTOMS </b>

SurveySymptoms(<u><i>symptomID</i></u>, <u><i>surveyID</i></u>)

symptomID and surveyID are a composite primary key. There are no dependencies that violate BCNF, hence this association relation is in BCNF.

<b> TEST </b>

Test(<u>testID</u>, testType, testDate, result, <i>naiveUserID</i>)

testID => testType

testID => testDate

testID => result

testID => naiveUserID

The same user can take multiple tests on the same day and get different results. So, there are no more FDs than those mentioned above. testID is the only candidate key, and so it is the primary key. This relation is in BCNF as the primary key is the only determinant of every FD. There is no partial dependency as well. There are no transitive dependencies. And there are no multivalued attributes.
